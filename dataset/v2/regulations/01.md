**Title:** New York Renewable Energy Siting Law §94-c

**Full Text (Written Summary Style):**

The **New York Renewable Energy Siting Law (§94-c of the Executive Law)** establishes an expedited and uniform procedure for the siting and permitting of major renewable energy facilities within New York State. 

Specifically:
- It applies to **renewable energy projects with a capacity of 25 megawatts (MW) or greater**.
- It **centralizes** the permitting process under the newly created **Office of Renewable Energy Siting (ORES)**.
- ORES is responsible for:
  - Reviewing applications
  - Issuing siting permits
  - Ensuring that projects meet uniform standards and conditions
  - Balancing renewable development goals with environmental protection and community engagement
- Local municipalities can submit input, but the law streamlines the overall process to meet the state’s **climate and energy targets** under the **Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA)**.
- The law aims to **reduce project timelines**, eliminate redundant processes, and create **greater predictability** for renewable energy developers.

**Key Objective:**  
Accelerate New York State’s transition to clean energy while maintaining robust environmental and community protections.
