**Title:** Nevada Renewable Energy Incentives Program §701B

**Full Text (Written Summary Style):**

The **Nevada Renewable Energy Incentives Program (§701B of the Nevada Revised Statutes)** establishes a framework of financial incentives to encourage the development and deployment of renewable energy projects across Nevada.

Specifically:
- The program offers **rebates, tax credits, and other financial incentives** to support the installation and operation of renewable energy systems, including **solar, wind, and geothermal** projects.
- Incentives are available to residential, commercial, industrial, and public sector participants, often in partnership with NV Energy, the state's primary electric utility.
- Projects eligible for incentives must meet specific technical, performance, and installation standards to ensure quality and long-term viability.
- The program is designed to help offset the upfront costs of renewable energy systems and to stimulate private investment in clean energy infrastructure.
- It complements Nevada’s broader renewable portfolio standard by helping the state achieve its mandated goals for renewable energy generation.
- Applications for program participation are reviewed and approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada (PUCN) and NV Energy under established guidelines and funding limits.

**Key Objective:**  
Promote the adoption of renewable energy technologies throughout Nevada by providing financial incentives that make solar, wind, and geothermal projects more economically viable.
