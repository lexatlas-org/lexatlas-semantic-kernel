**Title:** New York Brownfield Cleanup Program §27-1400

**Full Text (Written Summary Style):**

The **New York Brownfield Cleanup Program (§27-1400 et seq. of the New York Environmental Conservation Law)** establishes a voluntary program designed to encourage the remediation and redevelopment of brownfield sites — properties where contamination complicates reuse or redevelopment.

Specifically:
- The program offers **tax incentives**, including refundable tax credits, to participants who complete approved cleanup and redevelopment projects.
- It provides **liability relief** from state enforcement actions regarding site contamination for participants who remediate the site according to the standards set by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC).
- Sites must be accepted into the program through an application process demonstrating that contamination is present or suspected, and that redevelopment is planned.
- Cleanups must comply with an NYSDEC-approved remedial work plan, and a final Certificate of Completion is issued upon successful remediation.
- The program also supports New York State's broader environmental and economic development goals by facilitating the productive reuse of underutilized or abandoned properties.
- Certain projects located in economically distressed areas or used for affordable housing may qualify for enhanced tax benefits.

**Key Objective:**  
Promote the cleanup and sustainable redevelopment of contaminated properties in New York by offering financial incentives and liability protections under environmental oversight.
