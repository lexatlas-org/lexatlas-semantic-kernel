**Title:** California Title 24 – Building Energy Efficiency Standards

**Full Text (Written Summary Style):**

The **California Title 24 – Building Energy Efficiency Standards** sets forth mandatory requirements to improve the energy performance of residential and nonresidential buildings throughout California.

Specifically:
- Title 24 is part of the California Code of Regulations and is developed and maintained by the **California Energy Commission (CEC)**.
- The standards establish minimum requirements for building envelope design, mechanical systems (heating, ventilation, air conditioning), water heating, and lighting systems to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.
- Compliance is required for new construction, major renovations, and certain additions or alterations to existing buildings.
- Energy efficiency measures under Title 24 are integrated into the building permitting process, and compliance documentation must be submitted and approved before construction can proceed.
- The regulations are periodically updated to incorporate technological advancements, new materials, and evolving energy goals in alignment with California’s broader climate initiatives.
- Title 24 works in conjunction with other environmental policies such as the California Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32) and the State’s Zero Net Energy (ZNE) building targets.

**Key Objective:**  
Reduce statewide energy consumption and environmental impacts by mandating energy-efficient building practices for all new and significantly modified structures in California.
