**Title:** California Solar Rights Act ยง714

**Full Text (Written Summary Style):**

The **California Solar Rights Act (ยง714 of the California Civil Code)** ensures that homeowners have the right to install solar energy systems on their properties, safeguarding the adoption of renewable energy at the residential level.

Specifically:
- The law **prohibits homeowners' associations (HOAs)** and similar organizations from imposing restrictions that would significantly increase the cost of solar energy systems or significantly decrease their performance or efficiency.
- While HOAs may impose reasonable restrictions concerning aesthetics or safety, these restrictions must not make the installation or use of solar energy systems impractical or excessively costly.
- Any restriction that increases the cost of a system by more than ten percent or decreases its efficiency by more than ten percent is presumed to be **unreasonable** under the law.
- The Act enforces **state policy** promoting the use of solar energy and reduces barriers to clean energy deployment on private residential properties.
- Violations of the Solar Rights Act by HOAs can result in legal actions and the awarding of attorneys' fees to the prevailing party.

**Key Objective:**  
Facilitate widespread residential adoption of solar energy systems by limiting unreasonable restrictions from homeowners' associations and similar bodies.
