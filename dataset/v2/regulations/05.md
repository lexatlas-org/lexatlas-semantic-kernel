**Title:** California Carbon Capture and Sequestration Protocol §95800

**Full Text (Written Summary Style):**

The **California Carbon Capture and Sequestration Protocol (§95800 et seq. of Title 17, California Code of Regulations)** sets forth the regulatory framework for the permitting, monitoring, reporting, and verification of carbon dioxide (CO₂) capture and sequestration projects under California’s Cap-and-Trade Program.

Specifically:
- The protocol provides detailed standards for the **selection, design, operation, and closure** of CO₂ injection sites to ensure long-term containment of captured carbon emissions.
- Projects must obtain permits through the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and demonstrate compliance with strict **monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV)** requirements throughout the project lifecycle.
- Operators are required to implement and maintain MRV plans, conduct site characterization studies, and monitor injection activities to detect potential leaks or migration of CO₂.
- Only projects that meet all regulatory requirements can generate eligible compliance offset credits under California’s Cap-and-Trade system.
- The protocol aligns with the state’s broader goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the **California Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32)**.
- Strict penalties and corrective action requirements are imposed for any failure to maintain environmental integrity or public safety at sequestration sites.

**Key Objective:**  
Support California’s climate change mitigation goals by regulating carbon capture and storage activities to ensure the safe, permanent sequestration of carbon dioxide emissions.
