# **Residential Solar Energy Installation Project Objective – Summary**
 **Document ID: doc_002**,
The **project objective** is the **central guiding purpose** of a residential solar installation project governed by the California Solar Rights Act §714. It defines **what must be achieved** to ensure lawful installation of solar energy systems despite homeowners association (HOA) restrictions.

**Key Aspects of a Residential Solar Energy Installation Project Objective:**
- **Scope**: Install a solar energy system on a residential property in California, ensuring that the system design meets both energy production goals and reasonable aesthetic requirements.
- **Quality**: Comply with applicable building codes, safety standards, and performance expectations without violating the Solar Rights Act's protections.
- **Cost**: Complete the installation without incurring excessive costs caused by HOA-imposed restrictions, ensuring any additional costs remain within the ten percent (10%) threshold set by law.
- **Time**: Avoid significant installation delays due to HOA review processes, ensuring the timeline aligns with the homeowner’s project schedule and the Act’s protections.
- **Sustainability**: Contribute to California’s renewable energy goals by increasing the use of clean solar power at the residential level.

**Why the Objective is Critical:**
- Provides **clarity** to homeowners, contractors, and legal advisors regarding the homeowner’s protected rights.
- Guides **design and installation decisions** to preemptively address and comply with reasonable HOA standards without compromising project viability.
- Serves as a basis for **legal compliance** and potential enforcement if HOA restrictions become unlawfully burdensome.
- Ensures **resource efficiency** by preventing unnecessary redesigns or legal disputes.
- Protects homeowners’ investments in renewable energy infrastructure and supports broader environmental objectives.

**Typical Example of a Residential Solar Energy Installation Project Objective:**
> "Complete the installation of a 7-kilowatt rooftop solar energy system on a residential property in Los Angeles within three months, ensuring that any HOA-imposed conditions do not increase costs by more than ten percent or reduce system efficiency beyond ten percent, in full compliance with §714 of the California Civil Code."
