# **Agricultural Impact Mitigation Project Objective â€“ Summary**
 **Document ID: doc_010**
The **project objective** is the **central guiding purpose** of a renewable energy development project located on agricultural land, as governed by the New York Agricultural Impact Mitigation Guidance. It defines **what must be achieved** to maintain regulatory compliance and project approval.

**Key Aspects of an Agricultural Impact Mitigation Project Objective:**
- **Scope**: Develop and construct a renewable energy facility on agricultural land in New York, ensuring protection and preservation of agricultural resources during and after project activities.
- **Quality**: Complete and submit an Agricultural Impact Mitigation Plan (AIMP) that meets standards established by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets.
- **Cost**: Budget for all mitigation measures required under the AIMP, including soil restoration, drainage maintenance, and post-construction land rehabilitation.
- **Time**: Secure approval of the AIMP prior to commencing construction activities to avoid regulatory violations or disruption of project schedules.
- **Sustainability**: Minimize permanent loss of agricultural land and ensure that farming operations can continue where feasible, promoting long-term agricultural and environmental sustainability.

**Why the Objective is Critical:**
- Provides **clarity** to developers, contractors, and regulatory authorities regarding agricultural protection requirements.
- Guides **project design, construction practices, and site management** to minimize disruption to farmland.
- Serves as a basis for **legal compliance** to maintain project approval and avoid enforcement actions.
- Aligns **resource and construction planning** with mitigation obligations to avoid costly retroactive measures.
- Reduces **regulatory and reputational risks** associated with poor land stewardship or community opposition.

**Typical Example of an Agricultural Impact Mitigation Project Objective:**
> "Submit an approved Agricultural Impact Mitigation Plan and complete construction of a 40-megawatt solar energy facility on agricultural land in Ontario County, New York, by October 2027, fully complying with Agricultural Impact Mitigation Guidance requirements and within a total project budget of $65 million."
