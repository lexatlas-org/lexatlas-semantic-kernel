# **Coastal Construction Project Objective – Summary**
**Document ID: doc_006**
The **project objective** is the **central guiding purpose** of a coastal development project regulated under the Florida Coastal Construction Control Line Program §161.053. It defines **what must be achieved** to ensure lawful construction activities near sensitive coastal areas.

**Key Aspects of a Coastal Construction Project Objective:**
- **Scope**: Design and construct any structure within 50 feet landward or seaward of the established Coastal Construction Control Line (CCCL) in Florida.
- **Quality**: Ensure all construction activities meet the environmental and structural standards required to protect beach and dune systems from erosion and storm impacts.
- **Cost**: Include in the project budget the costs of environmental assessments, variance permit applications, and any additional mitigation measures required for compliance.
- **Time**: Secure a special variance permit from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) before initiating any construction activities within the regulated zone.
- **Sustainability**: Preserve coastal ecosystems and minimize risks to life, property, and natural resources associated with shoreline development.

**Why the Objective is Critical:**
- Provides **clarity** to developers, engineers, and environmental consultants about the permitting requirements specific to coastal construction.
- Guides **site planning and design decisions** to align with environmental protection standards and minimize impacts to natural shoreline defenses.
- Serves as a basis for **legal compliance**, preventing violations that could result in enforcement actions, fines, or mandated remediation.
- Ensures **resource alignment** to complete environmental studies, submit variance applications, and manage compliance documentation efficiently.
- Reduces **regulatory risks** by ensuring construction projects are fully authorized and environmentally responsible.

**Typical Example of a Coastal Construction Project Objective:**
> "Obtain a special variance permit and complete the construction of a beachfront residential property located 30 feet from the CCCL in Palm Beach County, Florida, by October 2026, in full compliance with §161.053 of the Florida Statutes, within a total development budget of $4 million."
