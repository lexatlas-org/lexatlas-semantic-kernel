# **Electrical Power Plant Development Project Objective – Summary**

The **project objective** is the **central guiding purpose** of a power plant development project governed by the Illinois Electrical Power Plant Siting Act §403.501. It defines **what must be achieved** to secure siting approval and comply with environmental review requirements.

**Key Aspects of an Electrical Power Plant Development Project Objective:**
- **Scope**: Develop a new electrical power plant facility in Illinois with a generation capacity exceeding 75 megawatts (MW).
- **Quality**: Complete a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in accordance with regulatory standards to demonstrate the project's environmental sustainability and community compatibility.
- **Cost**: Allocate sufficient budget to cover the preparation, submission, and potential mitigation measures required by the EIA and siting process.
- **Time**: Submit the completed EIA alongside the siting application within the regulatory deadlines to prevent application rejection or project delays.
- **Sustainability**: Identify, mitigate, and manage environmental impacts to ensure long-term operational compliance and environmental stewardship.

**Why the Objective is Critical:**
- Provides **clarity** to project developers, environmental consultants, and regulatory bodies regarding required environmental documentation.
- Guides **project planning** to ensure that site selection, facility design, and operations align with environmental best practices.
- Serves as a basis for **legal compliance** to secure the centralized siting license necessary for project advancement.
- Ensures **resource alignment** to complete technical studies, public consultations, and agency reviews effectively.
- Reduces **regulatory risks** by addressing potential environmental objections before the licensing decision.

**Typical Example of an Electrical Power Plant Development Project Objective:**
> "Complete a full Environmental Impact Assessment and obtain siting approval for a 100-megawatt natural gas-fired power plant in northern Illinois by June 2027, ensuring compliance with §403.501 requirements and within a development budget of $120 million."
