# **Carbon Capture and Sequestration Project Objective – Summary**

The **project objective** is the **central guiding purpose** of a carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) project regulated under the California Carbon Capture and Sequestration Protocol §95800. It defines **what must be achieved** to secure project certification and maintain regulatory compliance.

**Key Aspects of a Carbon Capture and Sequestration Project Objective:**
- **Scope**: Design, develop, and operate a carbon dioxide (CO₂) injection and storage site in California under the standards established by the California Air Resources Board (CARB).
- **Quality**: Implement a continuous monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) program that proves effective long-term containment of sequestered CO₂.
- **Cost**: Allocate adequate resources to cover permitting, monitoring system installation, long-term site management, and compliance reporting obligations.
- **Time**: Achieve certification milestones, including operational verification of CO₂ containment, within the project timeline to secure final approval and issuance of compliance offset credits.
- **Sustainability**: Contribute to California’s greenhouse gas reduction goals by ensuring the safe, permanent storage of captured carbon emissions.

**Why the Objective is Critical:**
- Provides **clarity** to project developers, environmental engineers, and regulatory agencies on the performance expectations for CCS projects.
- Guides **design, engineering, and monitoring strategies** to meet CARB’s stringent standards for storage integrity.
- Serves as a requirement for **legal compliance**, necessary for maintaining project licensing and eligibility for participation in the Cap-and-Trade system.
- Ensures **resource alignment** to address ongoing site monitoring, maintenance, and reporting.
- Reduces **regulatory and financial risks** associated with containment failures or noncompliance penalties.

**Typical Example of a Carbon Capture and Sequestration Project Objective:**
> "Develop and operate a CCS project storing 500,000 metric tons of CO₂ annually in Kern County, California, with continuous monitoring systems in place and full certification achieved by 2028, in compliance with §95800 of the California Code of Regulations and within a project budget of $250 million."
