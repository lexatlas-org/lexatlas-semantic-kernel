**Title:** Florida Coastal Construction Control Line Program §161.053

**Full Text (Written Summary Style):**

The **Florida Coastal Construction Control Line Program (§161.053 of the Florida Statutes)** establishes a system of permitting and regulation for construction activities along Florida’s coastline to protect the integrity of the state's beaches, dunes, and coastal ecosystems.

Specifically:
- The program defines **Coastal Construction Control Lines (CCCLs)**, beyond which no construction may occur without a permit from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP).
- The CCCLs are scientifically determined based on factors such as storm surge, wave action, and potential flooding, and are periodically updated to reflect changes in coastal conditions.
- Any construction, excavation, or alteration seaward of the CCCL requires a **Coastal Construction Permit**, ensuring that proposed activities will not weaken the natural shoreline defense mechanisms or adversely affect the beach-dune system.
- The permitting process includes assessments of environmental impact, structural integrity, and consistency with state coastal management policies.
- The law seeks to minimize threats to life, property, and the environment from coastal storms, erosion, and sea level rise.
- Unauthorized construction or violation of permit conditions can result in enforcement actions, including fines and restoration requirements.

**Key Objective:**  
Protect Florida’s beaches, dunes, and coastal infrastructure by regulating construction activities along vulnerable coastal zones through a permitting system based on scientifically established control lines.
