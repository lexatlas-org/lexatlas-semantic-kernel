**Full Text (Written Summary Style):**

The **Florida Electrical Power Plant Siting Act (ยง403.501 of the Florida Statutes)** establishes an integrated and centralized framework for the review and approval of large electrical power plants within the state.

Specifically:
- The Act applies to the construction and operation of **electrical power plants with a capacity of 75 megawatts (MW) or more**.
- It consolidates all state, regional, and local permitting requirements into a **single licensing process**, overseen by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.
- The licensing procedure requires a comprehensive review of the **environmental, public health, safety, and land use impacts** of proposed facilities.
- Environmental considerations include air and water quality, wildlife and natural habitats, and compliance with state and federal environmental laws.
- Local governments and state agencies participate in the process by submitting reports and recommendations, but the final licensing decision is made at the state level to ensure consistency and efficiency.
- The Act also aims to promote the **orderly development of electrical infrastructure** while minimizing adverse impacts on the environment and communities.

**Key Objective:**  
Provide a coordinated and thorough environmental review process for the siting of major electrical power plants to balance the state's energy needs with environmental protection and public interest.
