**Title:** Texas Renewable Portfolio Standard §39.904

**Full Text (Written Summary Style):**

The **Texas Renewable Portfolio Standard (§39.904 of the Texas Utilities Code)** establishes mandatory minimum targets for the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources by utilities operating within the state of Texas.

Specifically:
- The law requires electric utilities and competitive retail electric providers to ensure that a certain portion of the electricity they sell comes from **renewable energy sources** such as wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, and hydroelectric power.
- Initial targets set by the legislation included the development of **2,000 megawatts (MW)** of new renewable capacity by 2009, with a long-term goal significantly exceeding that benchmark.
- The program contributed to the rapid expansion of the wind energy industry in Texas, which now leads the United States in installed wind capacity.
- Renewable energy credits (RECs) are used as the compliance mechanism, allowing utilities to purchase or trade credits to meet their renewable energy obligations.
- The law promotes the diversification of Texas’s energy mix, enhances energy security, supports rural economic development, and helps reduce environmental impacts associated with traditional fossil fuel generation.
- The Public Utility Commission of Texas oversees the program and enforces compliance with renewable energy standards.

**Key Objective:**  
Encourage the development and integration of renewable energy projects across Texas to diversify the energy portfolio, enhance energy reliability, and promote environmental stewardship.
