Understood — I will no longer add the "**In Short**" section or the final question about continuing to the next document.

# **Renewable Energy Facility Project Objective – Summary**

The **project objective** is the **central guiding purpose** of a renewable energy development project subject to the New York Renewable Energy Siting Law §94-c. It defines **what must be achieved** to ensure that the facility complies with state regulations and can proceed legally to construction.

**Key Aspects of a Renewable Energy Facility Project Objective:**
- **Scope**: Develop a renewable energy facility with a generation capacity exceeding 25 megawatts (MW) within New York State.
- **Quality**: Design and construct the facility in accordance with environmental, technical, and community standards set forth by the Office of Renewable Energy Siting (ORES).
- **Cost**: Complete permitting, design, and construction within the budgetary framework set by project investors and in alignment with state compliance costs.
- **Time**: Secure the ORES siting permit before any site preparation or construction activities begin, adhering to statutory timelines for application review and approval.
- **Sustainability**: Support New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) goals by contributing to the state’s transition to clean energy.

**Why the Objective is Critical:**
- Provides **clarity** to developers, contractors, and state agencies regarding regulatory expectations.
- Guides **project planning and decision-making**, particularly concerning site selection, environmental review, and design parameters.
- Serves as a benchmark for **legal compliance** and ensures the project avoids costly delays, penalties, or litigation.
- Aligns **resource allocation** toward achieving environmental permitting and construction milestones efficiently.
- Minimizes **regulatory risks** and ensures smooth community engagement processes.

**Typical Example of a Renewable Energy Facility Project Objective:**
> "Obtain ORES approval and complete the construction of a 50-megawatt solar energy facility in central New York by December 2026, ensuring full compliance with §94-c standards, within a development budget of $80 million."
