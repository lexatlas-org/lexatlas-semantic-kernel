- **Cost**: Incorporate environmental assessment, cleanup, compliance monitoring, and related legal and administrative costs into the overall project budget.
- **Time**: Finalize and file the BSRA with the DEP before initiating rehabilitation or redevelopment activities, adhering to project and funding timelines.
- **Sustainability**: Promote the reuse of contaminated or underutilized properties to support economic development while protecting public health and the environment.

**Why the Objective is Critical:**
- Provides **clarity** to developers, environmental consultants, and government agencies regarding site responsibilities and legal obligations.
- Guides **remediation planning and execution** based on state-approved standards and schedules.
- Serves as a basis for **legal compliance** and eligibility for state and local incentives, including liability protection and tax credits.
