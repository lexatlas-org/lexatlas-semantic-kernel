# **Building Energy Efficiency Compliance Project Objective – Summary**

The **project objective** is the **central guiding purpose** of a construction project subject to California Title 24 – Building Energy Efficiency Standards. It defines **what must be achieved** to obtain building permits and meet the state’s mandatory energy conservation requirements.

**Key Aspects of a Building Energy Efficiency Compliance Project Objective:**
- **Scope**: Design and construct a commercial or residential building in California that fully meets the energy efficiency standards outlined in Title 24, Part 6.
- **Quality**: Prepare and submit verified compliance documentation demonstrating that the building’s design, systems, and construction practices align with Title 24 energy performance criteria.
- **Cost**: Incorporate energy-efficient materials, systems, and design strategies within the project budget to achieve cost-effective compliance without compromising quality or functionality.
- **Time**: Complete and submit the required Title 24 compliance documentation before applying for building permits to avoid project approval delays or denials.
- **Sustainability**: Promote long-term energy conservation, lower utility costs, and contribute to California’s greenhouse gas emission reduction goals through sustainable building practices.

**Why the Objective is Critical:**
- Provides **clarity** to architects, engineers, builders, and permitting authorities regarding energy efficiency obligations.
- Guides **building design and system selection** to meet or exceed minimum regulatory standards.
- Serves as a basis for **legal compliance**, ensuring that construction activities are authorized and permitted on schedule.
- Aligns **resource allocation** to complete design reviews, energy modeling, and documentation preparation efficiently.
- Reduces **regulatory and operational risks** associated with noncompliance, such as fines, redesign costs, or delayed project start dates.

**Typical Example of a Building Energy Efficiency Compliance Project Objective:**
> "Submit verified Title 24 Part 6 compliance documentation and obtain building permits for a 50,000-square-foot mixed-use development in San Diego, California, by January 2026, ensuring full compliance with energy standards and within a project construction budget of $35 million."
