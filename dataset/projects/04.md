# **Brownfield Redevelopment Project Objective – Summary**

The **project objective** is the **central guiding purpose** of a redevelopment project under the New York Brownfield Cleanup Program §27-1400. It defines **what must be achieved** to complete site remediation in compliance with state environmental standards and secure liability protections.

**Key Aspects of a Brownfield Redevelopment Project Objective:**
- **Scope**: Redevelop a brownfield site in New York State by completing all required environmental remediation activities under a Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) approved agreement.
- **Quality**: Achieve remediation standards set by the DEC to ensure that the site is safe for its intended use and qualifies for the issuance of a Certificate of Completion.
- **Cost**: Manage project costs effectively, incorporating remediation expenses and potential contingencies related to environmental conditions discovered during cleanup.
- **Time**: Complete remediation activities according to the agreed-upon schedule to maintain eligibility for liability protections and tax incentives.
- **Sustainability**: Restore and repurpose contaminated land for beneficial economic, residential, or community use while protecting human health and the environment.

**Why the Objective is Critical:**
- Provides **clarity** to developers, environmental consultants, and investors regarding regulatory expectations and project deliverables.
- Guides **remediation planning and execution** in accordance with state-approved standards and procedures.
- Serves as a foundation for obtaining **liability relief** and accessing significant tax incentives critical to the project’s financial viability.
- Aligns **resource allocation** toward achieving environmental cleanup and redevelopment milestones.
- Minimizes **regulatory and financial risks** associated with incomplete or noncompliant remediation efforts.

**Typical Example of a Brownfield Redevelopment Project Objective:**
> "Complete remediation of a 5-acre former industrial site in Brooklyn under a DEC-approved Brownfield Cleanup Agreement by March 2026, achieving eligibility for liability protections and state tax credits while staying within a $15 million total project budget."
