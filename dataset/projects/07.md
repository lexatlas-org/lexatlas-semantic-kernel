# **EPF-Funded Infrastructure Project Objective – Summary**

The **project objective** is the **central guiding purpose** of an infrastructure project receiving financial support under the New York Environmental Protection Fund (EPF) §54-0101. It defines **what must be achieved** to maintain eligibility for funding and comply with climate resilience requirements.

**Key Aspects of an EPF-Funded Infrastructure Project Objective:**
- **Scope**: Design and implement an infrastructure project that qualifies for EPF grant funding, such as water management systems, parks, or environmental facilities.
- **Quality**: Develop and submit a certified resilience plan that identifies, assesses, and proposes measures to address climate risks relevant to the project’s location and operations.
- **Cost**: Include resilience planning, certification, and necessary adaptive measures within the overall project budget submitted for EPF funding consideration.
- **Time**: Complete and submit the certified resilience plan according to EPF grant application timelines and requirements, ensuring no funding delays or disqualifications.
- **Sustainability**: Incorporate long-term environmental and climate resilience strategies into the project to enhance durability, functionality, and community protection.

**Why the Objective is Critical:**
- Provides **clarity** to project sponsors, engineers, and funding agencies regarding resilience and climate adaptation expectations tied to EPF grants.
- Guides **planning, design, and construction decisions** to align with New York State’s climate change adaptation goals.
- Serves as a foundation for **legal and financial compliance**, ensuring that projects remain eligible for EPF funding throughout their lifecycle.
- Aligns **resource management** to address both construction and resilience documentation requirements effectively.
- Reduces **regulatory and financial risks** associated with potential project disqualification or funding revocation due to noncompliance.

**Typical Example of an EPF-Funded Infrastructure Project Objective:**
> "Submit a certified resilience plan and complete the construction of a municipal stormwater management facility in Albany County, New York, by September 2027, in full compliance with §54-0101 of the Environmental Conservation Law and within an approved EPF-funded project budget of $6 million."
