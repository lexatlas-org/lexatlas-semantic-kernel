Got it! ðŸ”¥ Youâ€™re hitting a **P3018 migration error** because your Prisma migration is trying to **install the `pgcrypto` extension** â€” but Azure PostgreSQL **does not allow it by default** unless configured properly.

No worries, we can fix this! ðŸ”§ Letâ€™s go step-by-step:

---

# âš¡ Why this happens
Azure Database for PostgreSQL has a **controlled list of allowed extensions**.  
`pgcrypto` **IS allowed**, but **you** have to **enable it manually** using SQL!

---

# âœ… How to fix this

### Step 1: Connect to your Azure PostgreSQL server

Use `psql`, Azure Data Studio, or the Azure Portal Query Editor.

Example with `psql` CLI:
```bash
psql "host=your-server-name.postgres.database.azure.com port=5432 dbname=your-db-name user=your-admin-user@your-server-name password=your-password sslmode=require"
```

---

### Step 2: Enable the `pgcrypto` extension

Once connected, run:
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Important:**  
- You must be logged in as the **admin user** you created when you set up the server.
- Itâ€™s **case insensitive**, but still â€” write it like above for best practice.
- If you don't have rights, make sure you're not inside a restricted user or database.

---

### Step 3: Retry Prisma migration

Now re-run your Prisma migration:
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```
Or whatever command you were using.

---

# ðŸ›  Bonus Tip: If `pgcrypto` still isnâ€™t available
Sometimes if the **server parameters** restrict certain extensions, you may need to:

- Check if you're using **Flexible Server** (they have better extension support).
- If you're on **Single Server**, know that itâ€™s legacy and has stricter policies. (Consider migrating to Flexible Server.)

You can check allowed extensions via:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions;
```
Look for `pgcrypto` in the list!

# ðŸŽ¯ Quick Recap
| Problem | Solution |
|:---|:---|
| `pgcrypto not allow-listed` | Connect to DB, `CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;` |

Would you like me to show you a **quick Prisma schema example** that uses `pgcrypto` correctly too? (in case you need it for generating UUIDs or encryption) ðŸš€âœ¨  
Would take 30 seconds!
